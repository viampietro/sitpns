(*! ================================= !*)

(** * Basic types for Petri nets. *)

(** A place is identified by a unique index. *)

Definition Place := nat.

(** A transition is identified by a unique index. *)

Definition Trans := nat.

(** There are 4 kinds of edges : pre, post, inhib, test 
    along with "some" positive weight (default is 1 usually). *)

(** A given edge, either reaching in or coming out of a place,
    has some weight over 0 or 0 if the edge doesn't exist *)

Definition Weight := Trans -> Place -> nat.

(** ** Neighbour places for transitions. *)

(** Defines a structure associating a given transition t to its input
    and output places (see the [lneighbours] attribute in the Sitpn
    structure). *)

Structure Neighbours : Set := mk_neighbours {
                                  pre_pl : list Place;
                                  test_pl : list Place;
                                  inhib_pl : list Place;
                                  post_pl : list Place
                                }.

(** * Types for Time Petri Nets *)

(** Defines the inductive type to express positive or (positively)
    infinite values.  Useful to type the upper bound of the time
    interval in [TimeInterval]. *)

(** Defines the time interval structure associated with transitions. *)

Structure TimeInterval : Set :=

    }.

(** Defines the dynamic time interval type. 
    
    Differentiate the behavior of static and dynamic time
    intervals as in the STPN semantics.

    A dynamic time interval is either active or blocked. *)

Inductive DynamicTimeInterval : Set :=
| active : TimeInterval -> DynamicTimeInterval
| blocked : DynamicTimeInterval.

(** * Types for Interpreted Petri nets. *)

(** Defines condition, action and function types.

    Conditions, actions and functions are represented as natural
    numbers.

    The boolean value of conditions at a discrete time is given by a
    function that is external to the structure of SITPNs. This
    function represents the information coming to the digital system,
    which behavior is modeled with an SITPN, through sensors. *)

(** * Sitpn state structure.

      Describe the structure of an Sitpn state.
      
      An SitpnState instance has a meaning only if it is related to a
      given SITPN by the [IsWellDefinedSitpnState] relation (see
      definition below). Therefore, we express in comments properties
      of the SitpnState fields under the scope of an Sitpn instance.

      The rules defining how an Sitpn should go from one state to
      another are defined by the Sitpn semantics (see file
      SitpnSemantics.v).

      Depending on how a given Sitpn state is reached, i.e either
      after the occurence of falling edge or a rising edge of a clock
      signal, the meaning some of its fields changes. *)
